# PrimeGrid - Python

This project was inspired by the recent video of Daniel Shiffman (The Coding Train) named The Prime Spiral (Coding Challenge 167). This project was written entirely in python including external libaries for graphics(Pygame) and arrays(NumPy).

The primegrid(or prime spiral) is created by highlighting the prime numbers in an outward clockwise going spiral starting from one at the center of the screen.
